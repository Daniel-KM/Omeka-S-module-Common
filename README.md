Common Module (module for Omeka S)
===================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__


[Common Module] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to manage internal
features used in various modules: bulk functions, form elements, view helpers,
one-time tasks for install and settings, etc., so it avoids the developer to
copy-paste common code between modules.

- Services, view helpers and controller plugins

  - AssetUrl for internal assets
  - DefaultSite
  - DeferredJobDispatch, to run multiple individual jobs in bulk
  - EasyMeta to get ids, terms and labels from properties, classes, templates,
    vocabularies; to get main data types too (literal, resource or uri); to get
    resource api names from any names used in Omeka and modules.
  - FormatNumber, to get number formatted with the site or omeka locale
  - IsHomePage
  - IsHtml
  - IsXml
  - JSend to manage exchanges between a module and js part.
  - MatchedRouteName
  - SendEmail to send email with default values, in particular sender.
  - PrepareMessage to validate and fill messages with placeholders.
  - SpecifyMediaType

- Form elements

  - SendMessageForm (base form for sending messages with placeholders)
  - Array Text
  - Custom Vocab MultiCheckbox
  - Custom Vocab Radio
  - Custom Vocab Select
  - Custom Vocabs Select
  - Data Textarea
  - Data Type Select
  - Group Textarea
  - Ini Textarea
  - Note
  - Media Ingester Select
  - Media Renderer Select
  - Media Type Select
  - Secret
  - Sites Page Select
  - Optional Checkbox
  - Optional Date
  - Optional DateTime
  - Optional Multi Checkbox
  - Optional Number
  - Optional Radio
  - Optional Select
  - Optional Url
  - Optional Item Set Select
  - Optional Property Select
  - Optional Resource Select
  - Optional Resource Class Select
  - Optional Resource Template Select
  - Optional Role Select
  - Optional Site Select
  - Optional User Select
  - Url Query

- [PSR-3]

  - The logger can log messages in a standard, simple and translatable way.
  - The class PsrMessage extends core `\Omeka\Stdlib\PsrMessage` since Omeka S 4.2,
    with translator awareness, PSR-3 and sprintf support. A polyfill is provided
    for version before Omeka S 4.2.

- One-Time tasks

  Internally, the logic is "config over code": so all settings have just to be
  set in the main `config/module.config.php` file, inside a key with the
  lowercas emodule name, with sub-keys `config`, `settings`, `site_settings`,
  `user_settings` and `block_settings`. All the forms have just to be standard
  Laminas forms.

  Eventual install and uninstall sql can be set in `data/install/` and upgrade
  code in `data/scripts`. Another class allows to check and install resources
  (vocabularies, resource templates, custom vocabs, etc.).

- Improved media type detection

  In many cases, in particular with xml or json, the media type should be
  refined to make features working. For example `text/xml` is not precise enough
  for the module IiifServer to manage xml ocr alto files, that should be
  identified with the right media type `application/alto+xml`. The same issue
  occurs with xml mets, tei, json-ld, etc. Main formats for 3d files are managed.

- Internal assets

  By default, only external assets can be overridden in themes. This option in
  the config file allows to by-pass core assets. This is useful mainly for js in
  admin interface.

- Data base index

  To improve performance of common queries, some indices are added in database:

  - fulltext_search: is_public
  - media: ingester
  - media: renderer
  - media: media_type
  - media: extension
  - resource: resource_type
  - resource: idx_type_created (resource_type, created)
  - resource: idx_type_modified (resource_type, modified)
  - value: type
  - value: lang
  - value: idx_property_value (property_id, value (190))
  - session: modified


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

**IMPORTANT**: As long as [PR #2432] is not merged, use the Zip method or use
version 3.4.76.

* With composer (recommended, requires Omeka S with [PR #2432])

From the root of Omeka S, install the module:

```sh
composer require daniel-km/omeka-s-module-common
```

The module is automatically downloaded in `composer-addons/modules/` and ready to
be enabled in the admin interface.

* From the zip

Download the last release [Common.zip] from the list of releases, and uncompress
it in the `modules` directory.

* From the sources and for development

Install the sources in directory `modules`, rename the directory as `Common`, go
to the root of the module, run composer install, then :

```sh
cd modules
git clone https://gitlab.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Common.git Common
cd Common
composer install --no-dev
php ../../application/data/scripts/install-omeka-assets.php Common
```

* For test

The module includes a comprehensive test suite with unit and functional tests.
Run them from the root of Omeka:

```sh
vendor/bin/phpunit -c modules/Common/phpunit.xml --testdox
```


Usage (for developer)
---------------------

### Services, controller plugins and view helpers

#### Api Adapter: Simple and complete query builder

Just add the trait `CommonAdapterTrait`, declare `$queryFields` grouped by type,
and call `buildQueryFields($qb, $query)` at the start of `buildQuery()`. All
arguments accept a scalar or an array; empty values (`''`, `[]`, `null`) are
skipped.

`$queryFields` structure: an array keyed by *type*, each type mapping *query
argument name* to *entity field name*. Example:

```php
protected $queryFields = [
    'id' => [
        'owner_id' => 'owner',
        'resource_id' => 'resource',
        'site_id' => 'site',
    ],
    'int' => ['total' => 'total'],
    'int_operator' => ['count' => 'count'],
    'string' => ['name' => 'name'],
    'string_empty' => ['lang' => 'lang'],
    'string_operator' => ['title' => 'title'],
    'bool' => ['is_public' => 'isPublic'],
    'bool_null' => ['reviewed' => 'reviewed'],
    'datetime' => [
        'created_before' => ['<', 'created'],
        'created_after'  => ['>', 'created'],
    ],
    'datetime_operator' => ['created' => 'created', 'modified' => 'modified'],
];
```

Type reference:

| Type                | Accepts                | Behaviour                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                | int or int[]           | `<N>` = include, `0` = `IS NULL`, `-N` = exclude id `N`. Values are mixable.                                           |
| `int`               | int or int[]           | Exact match: `= :x` or `IN (…)`.                                                                                       |
| `int_empty`         | int or int[]           | Same as `int`, plus `0` means "empty" (`= 0 OR IS NULL`).                                                              |
| `int_operator`      | scalar or scalar[]     | Value prefixed by an operator among `< ≤ = ≠ ≥ >`. No prefix means `=`. Repeatable per operator.                       |
| `string`            | string or string[]     | Exact match: `= :x` or `IN (…)`.                                                                                       |
| `string_empty`      | string or string[]     | Same as `string`, plus the literal `''` (two single quotes) means "empty" (`= '' OR IS NULL`).                         |
| `string_operator`   | string or string[]     | Value prefixed by `< ≤ = ≠ ≥ >`. No prefix means `=`.                                                                  |
| `bool`              | scalar                 | Cast to `1`/`0`. Non-scalar produces an always-false where clause.                                                     |
| `bool_null`         | scalar or `'null'`     | Same as `bool`, plus the literal string `'null'` matches `IS NULL`.                                                    |
| `datetime`          | date/time-like string  | Declared as `[operator, field]`; one query argument per fixed operator (`<`, `>`, `≤`, `≥`). Historical Omeka pattern. |
| `datetime_operator` | date/time-like or `[]` | Value prefixed by `< ≤ = ≠ ≥ >`. Limited to years -9999..9999; older dates require the raw integer type on the column. |

Empty-value conventions:

- Empty string, empty array or `null` → argument silently ignored, so unset
  fields in a search form never filter anything.
- For `int_empty` / `string_empty`, the empty value (`0` and `''`) allows to
  search rows whose column is actually empty or null.

Combining arguments: all types add `AND` clauses between arguments. Multiple
values inside one array argument add `OR` inside that clause (`IN (…)` or
per-operator groups). For `id`, positive/`0`/negative can be mixed in the same
array — negatives become a separate `NOT IN … OR IS NULL` clause.

`buildQueryFields()` returns `true` if at least one field was actually applied.
It accepts an optional entity alias (default `omeka_root`) and an optional
`$queryFields` override, so it can be reused for joined entities.

#### Api Adapter: Simple hydrator

Just add the trait `CommonAdapterTrait` and it will automatically manage the
method `hydrate()` in a generic way, as long as the entity methods and the keys
used in the api or the form are compatible.

#### AssetUrl

Use helper assetUrl().

#### DefaultSite

Use helper defaultSite(). As argument, you may set id, slug, id_slug or slug_id.
The default is to return the representation.

#### Deferred Job Dispatch

Some modules run a job each time an item or a media is saved, in particular in
batch processes, and it implies multiple parallel jobs that are not consistent
or that overloads server. Furthermore, flushing entity inside an api event may
trigger a global flush that conflicts with pending entities in the doctrine
UnitOfWork.

To avoid this issue, use the service `Common\DeferredJobDispatch` in order to
send all resource ids to the job as a single request and dispatch them once at
shutdown. So the service can be used in a module event listener like that:

```php
$deferred = $services->get('Common\DeferredJobDispatch');
$deferred->defer(
    \MyModule\Job\MyJob::class,
    'job_key',
    ['item_ids' => $itemId]
);
```

At shutdown, one job per unique job key is dispatched, with all accumulated
params merged via the optional callback set as fourth argument.

Real life implementation can be seen in modules [Bulk Import], [Derivative Media],
[Easy Admin], [Iiif Server], or [Image Server].

#### Upgrade Job Dispatch

During a module upgrade, the module state in database is `needs_upgrade`, so
the module is not registered nor autoloaded. Any job dispatched from an upgrade
script would fail to bootstrap in its spawned CLI process: the job class does
not exist for the Module Manager, and `Dispatcher::dispatch()` itself checks
class existence.

The service `Common\UpgradeJobDispatch` works around this: it temporarily writes
the target version and sets `is_active = 1` in the `module` table, requires the
job files so `dispatch()` can validate the class, dispatches the job, waits
briefly for the child process to start, then restores the previous `is_active`
value. The Module Manager sets the real state and version once `upgrade()`
returns.

Usage from `data/scripts/upgrade.php`:

```php
$upgradeJobDispatch = $services->get('Common\UpgradeJobDispatch');
$jobDir = dirname(__DIR__, 2) . '/src/Job/';
$job = $upgradeJobDispatch(
    \MyModule\Job\MyJob::class,
    ['key' => 'value'],
    // Absolute paths of the job class and its traits: the module is not
    // autoloaded yet at this point.
    [$jobDir . 'MyJob.php'],
    // Optional; read from module.ini when null.
    $newVersion
);
```

The service returns the `Omeka\Entity\Job` created. When the child process is
still in `starting` status after the wait, a warning is added via the messenger
so the operator can relaunch it manually. The module id is inferred from the
first segment of the job class namespace.

Use this only for jobs that must run as part of an upgrade (data migration,
long-running conversion). For regular deferred jobs, use `DeferredJobDispatch`.

#### EasyMeta

This service can be used as helper or plugin. It allows to get ids, terms and
labels from properties, classes, templates, vocabularies; to get main data types
too (literal, resource or uri); to get resource api names from any names used in
Omeka and modules.

To get methods and more details, use the autocompletion of your IDE.

#### FormatNumber

This view helper formats a number with the grouping and decimal separators of
the current locale (site or admin).

```php
// 1 234 567,891 in French, 1,234,567.891 in English, 1’234’567.891 in Swiss German.
echo $this->formatNumber(1234567.891);

// The number of decimals may be fixed.
echo $this->formatNumber(1234.5, null, null, null, 2);

// The locale may be forced.
echo $this->formatNumber(1234.5, null, null, 'de_CH');
```

The locale is taken automatically from the translator, so it is the one already
determined by Omeka:

| Page        | Locale                                                   |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Public site | locale of the site, else of the user, else of the install |
| Admin       | locale of the user, else of the install                   |

It is a subclass of the helper `numberFormat` of Laminas, that is available by
default, and it keeps its arguments (style, type, locale, decimals, text
attributes). It is registered under another name, because its behavior differs
on two points:

- The locale is the one of the translator and not `Locale::getDefault()`, that
  Omeka fills only when the extension intl is loaded.
- The extension intl is not required. Without it, the class `NumberFormatter`
  does not exist and the helper of Laminas is a fatal error, so the number is
  formatted with `number_format()` and a list of separators extracted from icu.

Furthermore, a value that is not a number (`'abc'`, `null`, an array) is
returned as a string instead of throwing a `TypeError`, so a template never
breaks on a bad value. A numeric string (`'12'`) and a stringable object holding
a number are formatted.

The fallback without intl manages the decimal separator and the grouping
separator, that depend on the language and on the region: `de_DE` is `1.234.567,89`,
but `de_CH` is `1’234’567.89`. An unlisted region falls back on its language,
never on its region: so `br_FR` is formatted like `br`, and `ca_FR` follows
catalan and not french. It is identical to icu for eighty locales, and differs
for the seven ones that use their own digits (bengali, persian, burmese, nepali)
or that group by two digits (indian lakh: `12,34,567` for hindi, tamil, telugu).

#### IsHomePage

This view helper allows to check if the current page is the home page.

#### IsHtml

This view helper allows to check if a string is html, in particular to know if
it should be escaped or not.

The check is a basic one: the string should start with a "<", end with a ">" and
without tags. It may be a partial html. It is not possible to get a more precise
check before php 8.4.

#### IsXml

This view helper allows to check if a string is xml, in particular to know if
it should be escaped or not.

The check is a full one: the string should start with a "<", end with a ">" and
should be parsable via SimpleXml. It may be a partial xml.

#### jSend

The plugin jSend() allows to output a JsonModel formatted as [jSend] to simplify
exchanges with a third party or with a module that use some ajax, like [Contact Us],
[Contribute], [Selection], [Two Factor Authentication], etc.

Unlike [jSend], any response can have a status, data, a message and a code.
Some values are filled automatically from the messenger.

#### Messages

The method `getTranslatedMessages()` allows to get all translated messages as
array. It can be used for a json output.

The method `log()` allows to convert all messages into logs, for example to
manage background jobs and keep track of front-end messages of errors of some
modules.

#### Messenger

This is a fix on the core messenger: A form with any number of levels of
sub-messages can be managed.

#### MatchedRouteName

Allow to get the matched route name directly.

#### Note

`Note` is a form element to display explication inside forms. It is a simplified
version of feature from Zend 1 that was not ported to Zend 3/Laminas. It was
implemented in some modules.

#### SendEmail

Allow to send an email. All arguments are optional, except the body. The sender
is the no-reply email of the module [Easy Admin] by default, else the
adminstrator email defined in main setting.

A minimal antispam check is applied via keywords listed in `/data/mailer/spam_keywords.php`.
For improved checks, install module [Bot Guard].

#### SendFile

Send a file for download, without limit of size or memory, via a stream.
The content disposition can be set via the parameters of via the query (download=1
for attachment, else inline).

#### PrepareMessage

This controller plugin provides helper functions for preparing messages with
validation and placeholder support. It is designed to be used with modules like
[Contact Us], [Contribute], and [Selection].

Features:
- Validate message body and subject with configurable max lengths
- Fill messages with placeholders using moustache-style syntax (`{placeholder}`)
- Common placeholders are automatically available
- Extensible placeholder system for module-specific values

Common placeholders:
- `{ip}`: Client IP address
- `{main_title}`: Installation title
- `{main_url}`: Main URL
- `{site_title}`: Current site title
- `{site_url}`: Current site URL
- `{site_slug}`: Current site slug
- `{user_name}`: Current user name
- `{user_email}`: Current user email
- `{owner_name}`: Owner/recipient name
- `{owner_email}`: Owner/recipient email
- `{resource_id}`: Resource ID
- `{resource_title}`: Resource title
- `{resource_url}`: Resource public URL
- `{resource_url_admin}`: Resource admin URL

Resource property placeholders (when a resource is in context):
- `{prefix:localName}`: Value of any resource property (e.g. `{dcterms:title}`,
  `{dcterms:creator}`, `{dcterms:date}`). The first value is used if multiple
  values exist for the property.

Usage in a controller:

```php
// Validate message body.
$result = $this->prepareMessage()->validateBody($body);
if (!$result['valid']) {
    // Handle error: $result['error']
}

// Validate message subject.
$result = $this->prepareMessage()->validateSubject($subject);

// Fill a message template with placeholders.
$message = $this->prepareMessage()->fillMessage(
    'Hello {user_name}, your {resource_title} has been updated.',
    ['custom_field' => 'value'],  // Additional placeholders
    ['site' => $site, 'user' => $user, 'resource' => $resource]  // Context
);

// Add custom placeholders for all subsequent calls.
$this->prepareMessage()
    ->addPlaceholders(['custom_key' => 'custom_value'])
    ->fillMessage($template);

// Get default subject from settings with fallback.
$subject = $this->prepareMessage()->getDefaultSubject(
    'mymodule_email_subject',
    'Default subject for {site_title}',
    $placeholders,
    $context
);

// Process "myself" options for cc/bcc/reply-to.
$cc = $bcc = $replyTo = [];
$this->prepareMessage()->processMyselfOptions(
    ['cc', 'bcc'],  // Values from "myself" checkbox
    $user,
    $cc,
    $bcc,
    $replyTo
);
```

#### SendMessageForm

A base form class for sending messages that can be extended by modules.
It provides common fields (subject, body) and optional fields (cc, bcc, reply-to,
resource_id, reject checkbox, "myself" multi-checkbox).

Form options:
- `has_resource_id` (bool): Add a hidden resource_id field
- `resource_id_name` (string): Name of the resource id field (default: `resource_id`)
- `has_cc` (bool): Add cc email field
- `has_bcc` (bool): Add bcc email field
- `has_reply_to` (bool): Add reply-to email field
- `has_myself` (bool): Add "myself" multi-checkbox for cc/bcc/reply
- `has_reject` (bool): Add reject checkbox (for moderation workflows)
- `subject_value` (string): Default value for subject
- `body_value` (string): Default value for body

Usage in a module:

```php
// Option 1: Use directly with options.
$form = $this->getForm(\Common\Form\SendMessageForm::class);
$form->setFormOptions([
    'has_cc' => true,
    'has_bcc' => true,
    'has_myself' => true,
    'subject_value' => 'Your contribution',
    'body_value' => 'Dear {name}, thank you for your contribution.',
]);
$form->init();

// Option 2: Extend in your module.
namespace MyModule\Form;

use Common\Form\SendMessageForm as BaseSendMessageForm;

class SendMessageForm extends BaseSendMessageForm
{
    protected $formOptions = [
        'has_resource_id' => true,
        'resource_id_name' => 'contribution_id',
        'has_cc' => true,
        'has_myself' => true,
        'has_reject' => true,
    ];

    public function init(): void
    {
        parent::init();
        // Add custom fields here.
    }
}
```

#### SpecifyMediaType

Get the right media type of a file, even if it is a generic zipped, json or xml.
This helper is used automatically when loading a file via the internal file
factory.

### PSR-3

#### Role of PSR-3

The PHP Framework Interop Group ([PHP-FIG]) represents the majority of php
frameworks, in particular all main CMS.

[PSR-3] means that the message and its context may be separated in the logs, so
they can be translated and managed by any other compliant tools. This is useful
in particular when an external database is used to store logs.

The message uses placeholders that are not in C-style of the function `sprintf`
(`%s`, `%d`, etc.), but in moustache-style, identified with `{` and `}`, without
spaces.

The new and old format are automatically managed by the messenger and the
logger.

So, instead of logging like this:

```php
// Classic logging (not translatable).
$this->logger()->info(sprintf($message, ...$args));
$this->logger()->info(sprintf('The %s #%d has been updated.', 'item', 43));
// output: The item #43 has been updated.
```

A PSR-3 standard log is:

```php
// PSR-3 logging.
$this->logger()->info($message, $context);
$this->logger()->info(
    'The {resource} #{id} has been updated.', // @translate
    ['resource' => 'item', 'id' => 43]
);
// output: The item #43 has been updated.
```

If an Exception object is passed in the context data, it must be in the `exception`
key.

Because the logs are translatable at user level, with a message and context, the
message must not be translated when logging.

#### PSR-3 Message

If the message may be reused or for the messenger, the helper `PsrMessage()` can
be used, with all the values:

```php
// For logging, it is useless to use PsrMessage, since it is natively supported
// by the logging.
$message = new \Common\Stdlib\PsrMessage(
    'The {resource} #{id} has been updated by user #{userId}.', // @translate
    ['resource' => 'item', 'id' => 43, 'userId' => $user->id()]
);
$this->logger()->info($message->getMessage(), $message->getContext());
echo $message;
// Or with internal translator (laminas translator style).
echo $message->setTranslator($translator)->translate();
// With translator (Omeka core style, translator as first argument).
echo $message->translate($translator);
```

Since Omeka S v4.2, the core provides `\Omeka\Stdlib\PsrMessage`, which
implements `MessageInterface` and is natively recognized by the core translator
delegator. `Common\Stdlib\PsrMessage` extends it with additional features:

- TranslatorAwareInterface: set translator then use translate() without args.
- Variadic constructor: supports both PSR-3 array context and sprintf-style
  positional arguments for backward compatibility with \Omeka\Stdlib\Message.
- Polymorphic translate(): accepts TranslatorInterface as first arg (core) or
  translator interface aware signature (no args).

```php
// PSR-3 style (recommended):
$message = new \Common\Stdlib\PsrMessage('Hello {name}', ['name' => 'World']);

// Sprintf style (backward compatibility with \Omeka\Stdlib\Message):
$message = new \Common\Stdlib\PsrMessage('Hello %s', 'World');
```

For Omeka S < 4.2, a polyfill is provided in `data/compat/` that is loaded
automatically.

#### Translator

The translator to set in PsrMessage() is available through `$this->translator()`
in controller and view.

#### Compatibility

* Compatibility with core

`Common\Stdlib\PsrMessage` extends `\Omeka\Stdlib\PsrMessage`, so it implements
`MessageInterface` and is recognized natively by the core translator delegator,
the messenger, and the logger. No special handling is needed.

* Compatibility with messenger

The helper `messenger()` is compatible and can translate PSR-3 messages.

* Compatibility with the default stream logger

The PSR-3 messages are converted into simple messages for the default logger.
Other extra data are appended.

* Compatibility with core messages

The logger stores the core messages as it, without context, so they can be
displayed. They are not translatable if they use placeholders.

* Compatibility with thrown exceptions

An exception should not be translated early. Nevertheless, if you really need
it, you can use:

```php
# Where `$this->translator` is \Laminas\I18n\Translator\TranslatorInterface or
# MvcTranslator from services, either:
throw new \RuntimeException($this->translator->translate($message));
throw new \Exception($message->setTranslator($this->translator)->translate());
```

#### Plural

By construction, the plural is not managed: only one message is saved in the
log. So, if any, the plural message should be prepared before the logging.

### One-time tasks

Unlike old module Generic, Common use a trait to include features in module. To
use it, replace the following:

```php
namespace MyModule;

use Omeka\Module\AbstractModule;

class Module extends AbstractModule
{
}
```

with this class with the trait:

```php
namespace MyModule;

if (!trait_exists(\Common\TraitModule::class, false)) {
    if (file_exists(OMEKA_PATH . '/modules/Common/src/TraitModule.php')) {
        require_once OMEKA_PATH . '/modules/Common/src/TraitModule.php';
    } elseif (file_exists(OMEKA_PATH . '/composer-addons/modules/Common/src/TraitModule.php')) {
        require_once OMEKA_PATH . '/composer-addons/modules/Common/src/TraitModule.php';
    } elseif (file_exists(dirname(__DIR__) . '/Common/src/TraitModule.php')) {
        require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/Common/src/TraitModule.php';
    }
}

use Common\TraitModule;
use Omeka\Module\AbstractModule;

class Module extends AbstractModule
{
    const NAMESPACE = __NAMESPACE__;

    use TraitModule;
}
```

**WARNING**: With a trait, `parent::method()` is the method of `Omeka\AbstractModule`
if it exists. Furthermore, it is not possible to call a method of the trait that
is overridden by the class Module. This is why some methods are suffixed with
"Auto" that can be used in such a case.

### Config form "Apply" button

The trait can add an "Apply" button next to the standard "Submit" button on a
module config form. Unlike "Submit", which saves and returns to the module list,
"Apply" saves the settings and stays on the form (active tab included).

The button is opt-in per module: call `$this->appendConfigApplyAsset($renderer)`
in `getConfigForm()` to display it. The "stay on the form" behavior is handled by
the trait `handleConfigForm()`; modules that override `handleConfigForm()` must
call `$this->redirectToConfigFormOnApply($controller)` before returning, so it
also runs after their own processing (saved settings, dispatched jobs, etc.).

The button can also be enabled globally for every module config form (even
modules that do not use the trait) with an option provided by module
[Easy Admin].

### Secret settings (encrypted at rest in database)

To store a sensitive setting (API key, password, token), use the form element
`Common\Form\Element\Secret` instead of a text or password element:

```php
use Common\Form\Element as CommonElement;

$this->add([
    'name' => 'mymodule_api_key',
    'type' => CommonElement\Secret::class,
    'options' => [
        'label' => 'API key', // @translate
    ],
    'attributes' => [
        'id' => 'mymodule_api_key',
    ],
]);
```

The element and its view helper `formSecret` handle only the presentation:

- the input is a plain text field by default (clearer when typing a value) and
  excluded from autofill; set the element option `masked` to true to render a
  password input instead;
- a lock icon always marks the field as a secret, and turns green when a value is
  already saved;
- the stored value is never echoed back to the browser;
- when a value is already set, a checkbox "remove the saved value" (`{name}_remove`)
  is appended and the placeholder is replaced by "leave empty to keep the current value".

A form element cannot handle persistence, because that happens at submit time
and the value is not resent. Where that logic lives depends on how the form is
saved:

- Module config form: nothing to do. The trait `handleConfigForm()` detects the
  Secret elements, encrypts them with the service `Omeka\Cipher` on save, keeps
  the current value on empty submission, and clears it when the companion
  `{name}_remove` checkbox is checked. Display is handled by `blankSecretFields()`.
- Entity or resource form  (saved through an api adapter, not the trait): apply
  the same three rules in the adapter `hydrate()`: encrypt the non-empty value
  with `Omeka\Cipher`, keep the existing stored value when the submission is
  empty (and no `{name}_remove`), and clear it when `{name}_remove` is checked.
  Decrypt in the representation when the value is read. The trait cannot reach
  an entity adapter, so this cannot be shared with it yet.

**Important**: the `{name}_remove` checkbox is raw markup injected by the view
helper at render time, not a Laminas form element. So it is present in the raw
HTTP post but absent from `$form->getData()`, which only returns the declared
elements. The trait works because it reads the raw post (`$controller->getRequest()->getPost()->toArray()`).
A controller that persists through `$form->getData()`, typical for an entity or
an adapter form, must therefore carry the remove flags over from the raw post
itself before saving, otherwise removing a secret silently does nothing:

```php
$data = $form->getData();
$postClient = $this->params()->fromPost('o:settings')['client'] ?? [];
foreach (['password_remove', 'admin_password_remove'] as $key) {
    if (!empty($postClient[$key])) {
        $data['o:settings']['client'][$key] = $postClient[$key];
    }
}
// ... then hydrate/save $data; the adapter reads the *_remove flags.
```

Secrets are only encrypted when a key is configured (auto-generated in `config/secret_key.php`
on install, or the environment variable `OMEKA_SECRET_KEY`); otherwise they are
stored clear.

**Scope / current limitation.** The trait wires the Secret handling
(`blankSecretFields` on display, `applySecretFields` on save) only in the module
**config form** (`getConfigForm()` / `handleConfigForm()`). It is **not** applied
to the main settings, site settings, user settings, or theme settings pages:
`handleAnySettings()` builds the fieldset but calls neither, and there is no
theme-settings handler at all. A Secret element placed in a `SettingsFieldset`,
`SiteSettingsFieldset`, `UserSettingsFieldset`, or a theme settings would
therefore be rendered with its stored value in the HTML (no blanking) and saved
as-is (no encryption) — worse than a plain text field. Until this is wired,

- use `Secret` only in a module **config form**, or
- handle encryption, blanking, keep-on-empty and the raw-post `{name}_remove`
  flag yourself in whatever code builds and saves that particular form (see the
  entity/adapter case above).

### Installing resources

To install resources, the class `ManageModuleAndResources` can be used. It is
callable via the module `$this->getManageModuleAndResources()`. It contains
tools to manage and update vocabs, custom vocabs, and templates via files
located inside `data/`, that will be automatically imported.

```php
if (!class_exists(\Common\ManageModuleAndResources::class, false)) {
    if (file_exists(OMEKA_PATH . '/modules/Common/src/ManageModuleAndResources.php')) {
        require_once OMEKA_PATH . '/modules/Common/src/ManageModuleAndResources.php';
    } elseif (file_exists(OMEKA_PATH . '/composer-addons/modules/Common/src/ManageModuleAndResources.php')) {
        require_once OMEKA_PATH . '/composer-addons/modules/Common/src/ManageModuleAndResources.php';
    } elseif (file_exists(dirname(__DIR__) . '/Common/src/ManageModuleAndResources.php')) {
        require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/Common/src/ManageModuleAndResources.php';
    }
}
```


TODO
----

- [ ] Use key "psr_log" instead of "log" (see https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-log/service-manager/#psrloggerabstractadapterfactory).
- [ ] Use materialized views for EasyMeta?
- [ ] Wire the Secret handling (blank/encrypt/keep/remove) into main/site/user/theme settings pages, not only module config forms (see [pull request #2529](https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/pull/2529)).
